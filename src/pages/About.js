      <p>
        Kiss The Cook is a web application where you can create your own
        e-cookbook; a place to store your favourite, personalised recipes, and
        access them anywhere online.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by my own desire for a purpose-built
        application that could store and organise the many different recipes
        that I had collected over the years. A key requirement of the
        application was the ability to easily add and edit recipes (especially
        in the midst of kitchen chaos), as they are tried and tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        This first build focuses on the initial key functions to add, edit,
        browse, view, and delete recipes. One of the main challenges of this
        build was achieving the multi-part functionality for the ingredients
        input, with self-generating components on multiple levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further builds will add functionality to create highly editable
        collections of recipes (cookbooks), as well as several search
        capabilities, and ultimately memebers-only fucntionality for a truly
        personalised and secure application.
